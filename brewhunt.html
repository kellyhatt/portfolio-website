              A web application showcasing the best local brews with even better discounts. In the spring of 2019 I embarked on an exciting new direction, the first step in a change of career with the help of Career Foundry’s UX Design Course. Throughout this 600 hour program I applied the UX techniques learnt and created this web app, Brew Hunt.

                  <h3>Research</h3>
                  <p>
                    Initial Hypothesis:
                    When on a city break, users have limited time to discover the area and the place they are visiting. Providing users with interesting local facts and beverages to aid their discovery of the area will save time and enable them to see and experience the highlights of the city.
                    We know this to be true when we see how many users are engaging with the app in different locations all over the world.
                    <br>
                    To take advantage of deals and vouchers users currently have to purchase these via an app which they find to be a long and tedious process. By eliminating the need for in app offers and vouchers to be purchased and instead, having them redeemable by presenting to the relevant location. Users will not feel the need to organise their trip so rigidly and can enjoy a spontaneous exploration of the city with the advantage of knowing they can discover discounts along the way.
                    We know this to be true when users can the QR codes and reveal the discounts.

              <h3>Ideation</h3>
                <p>
                    Example user flows and user personas helped shape the app and keep the screens to a minimum, improving the users experience and keeping the information concise and enjoyable to use.
                    Focusing on the flow instead of the individual screens allowed me to walk through the flows from the users point of view.

                  <h3>Wireframing</h3>
                  <p>
                    Wireframes were tested throughout the iterative design process focusing on the three features.
                  </p>​​​​​​
                  <h4>Filter feature</h4>
                  <p>
                    After identifying important issues through interviewing and testing, I designed solutions with these in mind.
                    The content of this filter feature and bar information was raised as an integral issue for users. To help solve this problem I introduced an icon and a wide range of filters so that as many scenarios as possible could be filtered. This would eliminate the need for users to search several different web apps before finding their desired destination.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Discount feature</h4>
                  <p>
                    Many users were intrigued and excited by this feature before the wireframing process but found it hard to understand and often asked several follow up questions. They wanted a way of easily earning rewards and vouchers but didn't want to purchase them or commit to a specific venue before experiencing it. With this in mind, I designed a screen that simplified the process of earning and viewing the discounts and giving users complete control over their own discount vouchers, including when they want to redeem them.
                  </p>
                  <h4>Review Feature</h4>
                  <p>
                    The ability to read reviews and share their own views was important to users and something that they have found unreliable in other products.

                    <h3>Design</h3>
                    <p>
                      Accessibility is integral to successful design, following iterations of each wireframe and further testing the design was adjusted to be more inclusive and accessible to a wider range of users.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The background image in the landing page has an opaque overlay but the lighter text is partially lost. To improve this I added an additional darker shape underneath both the text and CTA to make them stand out more.

                  In the login process users are prompted with placeholder text with what they should enter into the two fields to be able to sign in. Once selected, this text disappears, which may cause confusion if the user is distracted or forgets what they are meant to be entering. To assist the users further in this process, I have moved this placeholder text to the heading of each form field and added additional prompts.

                    The colours in the search results design do not score highly enough for a AAA rating. The orange and white combination scored 5.6:1, rating it as an AA score. By amending these colours to the red in my colour palette, in both the buttons and the outline of the search bar the rating is now AAA and scores 9.88:1.
